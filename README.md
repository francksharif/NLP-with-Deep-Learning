This repository contains a set of projects i did during my last class IFT6289 NLP with Deep Learning.
The purpose of the repo is to showcase each DL algorithm or technique used in NLP and implement it from scratch and present everything in a detailled report.
Each project is autonomous and has its description on how it works and how to set everything.
